# 🌐 KeshavSoft Website – Internship Project

### Intern Name: PATHAN SUBHANI  
### Internship Title: Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration  
### Company: KeshavSoft  
### Time Taken: Around 2 hours 

## Project Overview

This project was part of my internship task to explore **Bootstrap 5** and create a simple, responsive website using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
The aim was to design a clean company showcase site with proper navigation and layout.
The website includes:
- **Home Page** – Carousel, services, and intro  
- **About Page** – Mission and company details  
- **Contact Page** – Contact form and map
- 
## Work Process

I first set up the files (`index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `styles.css`) and linked Bootstrap and Google Fonts.  
Then, I used ready Bootstrap components like the navbar, cards, and carousel.  
After designing, I customized the colors to a **light pink theme** and adjusted spacing for a neat look.  
Finally, I deployed it to **GitHub Pages**.
